# OCC and MVCC Protocol Simulation

This task is created for major assignment of Database Management subject. 

## Running this program

To run this program, simply do ```python.py main.py```. It will run both OCC and MVCC. If you want to change the test case, please change the path in main.py.

## Limitation of this program

Because this program is to simulate incoming transaction (which is deterministic), I decided not to use threads. 


## Authors

Me, myself, and I.
